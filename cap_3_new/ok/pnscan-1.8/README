INTRODUCTION

Pnscan is a tool that can be used to survey TCP network
services.

For example, it can be used to survey the installed versions of
SSH, FTP, SMTP, Web, IDENT and possibly other services.

The latest version of pnscan can always be downloaded
from:

	ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/unix/pnscan

There is also a web page about it at:

	http://www.lysator.liu.se/~pen/pnscan


If you like it then I'd gladly accept nice bottle of whisky,
some free beer or even just a "Thank you!" email :-)



INSTALLATION

Possibly edit the "Makefile" and the run 'make <SYSTEM>' where <SYSTEM>
currently may be:

	lnx	Linux with GCC v2
	gso	Solaris with GCC v3
	sol	Solaris with Forte C


USAGE

pnscan defaults to start one thread per host and service to
probe - up to a maximum either as specified with the "-n"
command line option, or 8 minus the maximum number of
available file descriptors (pnscan tries to increase
it to the max limit automatically).

Host ranges can be specified both as a CIDR - network
name or IP address / mask bit length. For example:

	192.168.0.0/24
	arpanet/8

The CIDR names are looked up in "networks" (/etc/networks
or the YP/NIS+/whatever equivalent).

The host ranges can also be specified as a range (or
a single address) of hostnames or IP addresses:

	some.where.com:otherplace.where.com
	192.168.10.27:192.168.11.194
	localhost


Port ranges can be specified both via symbolic names
looked up in "services" (/etc/services or YP/NIS+/whatever
equivalent) or as numbers:

	ssh:telnet
	22:23
	113

The strings used with "-w" and "-r" may contain escaped characters.

pnscan by default will start printing the output from the first line
recevied - *or* from the start of a match with "-r" (or from the first
line of the first match if used with the "-l" option).


EXAMPLES

# Scan network 192.168.0.0/24 for SSH daemons on port 22
pnscan 192.168.0.0/24 22
pnscan 192.168.0.1:192.168.0.254 ssh

# Scan hosts 192.168.10.34 ... 98 for IDENT servers
pnscan -n8 -w"VERSION" 192.168.10.34:192.168.10.98 113

# Scan host 127.0.0.1 for WWW servers on all ports
pnscan -w"HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" -r"Server:" 192.168.0.32 1:65525
pnscan -w"HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" -r"Server:" localhost 1:65525

# Scan for Roxen servers and print the whole Server-line
pnscan -l -w"HEAD / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n" -r"Roxen" localhost 1:65525

# Scan network arpanet/24 for daytime servers and sort them IP-numerically
pnscan arpanet/10 daytime | ipsort

# Read host/port pairs from stdin and scan the selected hosts
echo '192.160.10.11 ssh' | pnscan -v


Start pnscan with "-h" for online help.
