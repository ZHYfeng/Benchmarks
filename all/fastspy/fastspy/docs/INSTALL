Windows:

Copy the executable program in one dir, better if it's in PATH. If you
want to obtain a more accurate scan make sure the services file in the
package has  been copied in the  place of the original  system one (in
the case  make a backup  copy of the  original). The service  file for
win9x should be found in  "DRIVE$\windows" directory whereas the WinNT
version should be  found in "DRIVE$\WINNT\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC\". This
file contains only the definitions of  all ports that the system knows
and should be possibile to modify without any problem.

Linux:

Make sure you have:
glibc >= 2.1.2 with linuxthreads

just type "make" 
and "make install"

and you get fastspy working (I swear).

enjoy it
