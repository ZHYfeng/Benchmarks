NAME:
        FastSpy
        
CATEGORY:
        Network port scanners, security auditing tools.

DESCRIPTION:

        Fastspy  is  a  free  (GPL)  multiplatform  tool  to
        inspect   network   enviroments   over   potentially
        security flaws.

        Its most simple features  include scanning of active
        ports on a target machine  by services file or ports
        range, subnet scan using wild chars to looking for a
        specific  service over  a wide  range of  addresses,
        also it performs logging and reporting.

        Some advanced  features include possibility  to send
        user data over  a connection during the  scan to log
        server response.  It can also read  a user specified
        list of hosts to check instead of using command line
        options.  Also, timing  controls to  force a  low or
        high network impact.

DETAILS:

        Fastspy  is  designed  to  be  a  high-multithreaded
        program, the scan is implemented by a massive thread
        generation  routine  to  maximize  network  bandwith
        optimizing idle-time connection response.

NOTES:   

        One  of  Fastspy goals  is  the  portability of  the
        source code across different operating systems.
        To do this it  simply implements an embedded "Kernel
        Abstraction  Library"  customizables  to  reach  the
        requested functionality indipendently from OSes.
        Currently  it   has  been  successfully   ported  to
        win32  enviroments (winnt,  win9x) and  un*x (posix)
        flavours.
